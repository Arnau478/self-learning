# What is this repo?
If I know how to develop a compiler, a bootloader or things like that, is because of a lot of online resources. So I made a list of resources that helped me to learn about multiple aspects of computer programming. If you are looking for a book to read, take a look at the following, it may motivate you.

## Books
